Esoteric Programming Language

# EZPZ
This is my submission for the Estoric language problem statement . I've tried to develop an interpreter with a unique syntax . The structure of the language is very much based on structure of pascal programs.
In this project I've implemented simple mathematical calculations,variable assignment,conditional opertors,write statement,boolean operarots,error handling,nested procedures and conditional constructs of if ,elseif,else .This program lacks construct for looping statements which remains a scope for future improvement in the project.

Here is a sample code in the developed language,it explores the nested conditional consrtuct and comparison using  EZPZ :

    Abjohyahih Main;
  
        var a, b : inthye;
        
    shuruyahase
        a := 12;
        agarhomie a = 1 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 1...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 2 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 2...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 3 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 3...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 4 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 4...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 5 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 5...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 6 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 6...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna agarhomie a = 7 fir
          shuruyahase
            likhline('this is the if 7...');
          khatamhogyatatabyebye
        varna
            agarhomie a = 12 fir
                likho('It is 12! Yeah baby...!!! BTW: this is a nested If... pretty cool eh...?')
            varna
                likho('I dont know what is it :(');
    khatamhogyatatabyebye.
    
    OUTPUT:
    
    It is 12! Yeah baby...!!! BTW: this is a nested If... pretty cool eh...?
    
 Here is the list of keywords for the language with their pascal analogues for better understanding and easy readability of code.They can be used to write your own code in EZPZ.

Hope you liked EZPZ.
